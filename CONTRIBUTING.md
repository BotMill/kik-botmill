# Contributing to Kik-BotMill

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Kik-Botmill.

**<h3>General Issues, Concerns or Inquiries</h3>**
Our source is open to anyone who's interested in making Bot's using the beautiful Java Programming Language and when we say it's open source, it is literally open. You can just download the actual code and use it as per our licensing terms. All we want in addition to our terms is that you give us your feedback. We passionately created this framework and we want to improve it the best way we can - but we can only do that if you help us. If you found any bugs, issues, ideas or even inquiries, raise a ticket [here](https://github.com/BotMill/kik-botmill/issues).

**Things to note**  
- Make sure that you write descriptive issues. If possible, provide stack trace or screenshots. The more information the better.  
- Tag it accordingly.  

**<h3>Code Contributor</h3>**
