# Kik-BotMill - Tools to Mill Kik Bots

Inspired by our first ever Bot Framework [FB-BotMill](https://github.com/BotMill/fb-botmill)

Kik-BotMill is designed to ease the process of developing, designing and running bots that exist inside Kik Messenger. 

It provides a semantic Java API that can be imported on your Java EE Project to send and receive messages from Kikso that developers can focus on developing the actual application instead of dealing with Kik API endpoints.
